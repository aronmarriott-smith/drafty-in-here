== Email Trouble Shooting Guide ==
*Not receiving Drafty emails?*
= Do you have any draft posts? =
The email will never be sent if you do not have any draft posts.

= Have you scheduled your email?** 
You can check this in the plugin admin screen.

= Is your email address correct? =
You can check this in the plugin admin screen.

= Have you checked your email spam folder? =
Sometimes email may end up in your spam folder.

= Is your blog receiving enough traffic? =
Our plugin works off the 'WordPress Cron' mechanism which means your email can only be sent when someone lands on your site. This can be a problem if you do not have enough traffic. For more help on this issue please check out this guide from Host Gator: [How to Replace WP-Cron With a Linux Cron Job](http://support.hostgator.com/articles/specialized-help/technical/wordpress/how-to-replace-wordpress-cron-with-a-real-cron-job)

= Are you receiving ANY WordPress emails from your site? =
If you are not receiving emails for example when someone post a comment  or WordPress automatically updates, there may be something wrong with the way your WordPress site is set up to send email.
